# vui

Small Conversational speech models that can run on device

# Installation

*Before running `demo.py`, you must accept model terms for [Voice Activity Detection](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/voice-activity-detection) and [Segmentation](https://huggingface.co/pyannote/segmentation) on Hugging Face.*

## Linux
```sh
uv pip install -e .
```
## Windows
Create and activate a virtual environment
```pwsh
uv venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```
Install dependencies 
```pwsh
uv pip install -e .
uv pip install triton_windows
```

# Demo

[Try on Gradio](https://huggingface.co/spaces/fluxions/vui-space)

```sh
python demo.py
````

# Models

- Vui.BASE is base checkpoint trained on 40k hours of audio conversations
- Vui.ABRAHAM is a single speaker model that can reply with context awareness.
- Vui.COHOST is checkpoint with two speakers that can talk to each other.

# Voice Cloning

You can clone with the base model quite well but it's not perfect as hasn't seen that much audio / wasn't trained for long

# Research

vui is a llama based transformer that predicts audio tokens.

fluac is a audio tokenizer based on descript-audio-codec which reduces the number of codes per second by 4 from 86hz to 21.53hz

# FAQ

1) Was developed with on two 4090's https://x.com/harrycblum/status/1752698806184063153
2) Hallucinations: yes the model does hallucinate, but this is the best I could do with limited resources! :(
3) VAD does slow things down but needed to help remove areas of silence.
